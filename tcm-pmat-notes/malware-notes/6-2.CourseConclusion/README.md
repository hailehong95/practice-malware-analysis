# Course Conclusion

If you're reading this, congratulations! You have made it all the way through Practical Malware Analysis & Triage. I hope you enjoyed this course! If you have any feedback, I'd love to hear how I can make this course better. Feel free to DM me on Discord and let me know your thoughts on how to improve this course for future students.

I wanted to end with a few further readings & resources to give you a good idea on where to continue your malware analysis & RE journey. 

# Further Readings & Resources

## Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software by Michael Sikorski & Andrew Honig

[![pma][pmabadge]][pma]

One of the only course textbooks that was so good, I purchased it after the course was done. Practical Malware Analysis is the spiritual ancestor of this course, and my methodology has been greatly influenced by the amazing information present in this book. There is no single better resource for malware analysis and RE to keep on hand than PMA.

## MalwareUnicorn Reverse Engineering Workshops

Amanda Rousseau's ([Malware Unicorn](https://twitter.com/malwareunicorn)) reverse engineering workshops, which contain in-depth technical explorations of different RE topics. Available for free! 


## Zeltser.com | Lenny Zeltser

A fantastic compilation of malware analysis resources produced by the man himself.

## John Hammond

I am but a disciple of this field: John Hammond is the true jedi master. John puts out amazing RE content on his YouTube channel. He's a true gent and master of the craft and I recommend all of his RE/Analysis videos for further reading/viewing

## References

Writing both the material and the malware for this course was an amazing challenge. I relied heavily on the following resources to produce the malware and the content for this course. If there is one thing I'm good at, it is staying balanced while on the shoulders of giants.

In no particular order:

- Florian Roth & YARA
- OffensiveNim | byt3bl33d3r
- ired.team
- PMA | Andrew Honig & Mike Sikorski
- MalwareUnicorn RE Workshops
- Jean-Francois Maes | redteamer.tips
- RastaMouse
- Prof Jonathan Weissman | RIT
- eLS | eCPTX
- John Hammond
- Too many one-off blog posts and errant google searches to keep track of. Thank you all :)
