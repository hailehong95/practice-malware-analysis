# Course Final

## Overview
Outstanding work, Analyst! You've come far and learned a lot about the field of malware analysis. But you're not done yet.

And in fact, if you want to do this for good, you'll never be done. None of this knowledge is earned for its own sake. We need to apply this knowledge to make the cyber world safer.

## Objective

So, your course final is simple:

- Choose any single sample from this course.
- Write a triage report for your chosen sample.
- Write a set of Yara rules for the sample. 
- Then, publish the report and rules open-source and tell the world.

You can publish your findings anywhere. I recommend adding them to a public GitHub repo or writing a blog post. But however you decide to do it, publish it for the world to see.

When you're done, post a link to it in the `#course-final` channel in the Discord! Then, go to the `#i-finished` channel and claim your `@PMAT-graduate` role on the server.
